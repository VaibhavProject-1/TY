I have provided the packet tracer file for reference so you can confirm the addrress and settings

To check connectivity you can use ping command from pc0 to pc1 or vice versa on the IP address of the given pc and also when you download and run the ping command it would fail for first three to four tries and later be able to ping properly so please keep that in mind
